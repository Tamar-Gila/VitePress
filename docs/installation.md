## System requirements

- Operating system: Windows 10/11
- Disk space: 1GB available
- Administrator privileges: Required for installation

## Installation steps:

1. **Download the device:** Download the installation file appropriate for your operating system
2. **Running the installation:** As an administrator, double-click the downloaded file [Download DataGuard Encryptor (version 1.0.0)](https://example.com/dataguard-encryptor-setup.exe)

   - Read and accept the license agreement
   - Select the installation path
   - Allow the software to create a shortcut on the desktop

3. **Complete the installation:** Click 'Install' and wait for the process to complete.
4. **Initial Activation and Password Creation:** Launch DataGuard Encryptor. The first time you run it, you will be asked to create a password, choose a strong password and keep it in a safe place! This is the only password that will allow you to access your encrypted data.
5. **Start encryption:** You can now start encrypting files and folders using the software

## Troubleshooting common problems:

- **Drive encryption error:** Make sure the drive is not in use and you have full permissions
- **I forgot my master key:** Unfortunately, without the master key, encrypted data cannot be recovered. This is the high level of security of DataGuard
- **The software is not responding:** Try restarting your computer and checking for system updates.
